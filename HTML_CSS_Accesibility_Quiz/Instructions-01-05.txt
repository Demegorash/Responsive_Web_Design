Accessibility is making your webpage easy for all people to use â€“ even people with disabilities.

In this course, you'll build a quiz webpage. You'll learn accessibility tools such as keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices.

*************************************************

Step 1
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.

Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.

*************************************************

Step 2
You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.

Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.

The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.

*************************************************

Step 3
Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).

Add a viewport definition with a content attribute detailing the width and initial-scale of the page.

*************************************************

Step 4
Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.

Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute.

*************************************************

Step 5
Lastly in the head, the title element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page. Furthermore, it is an important part of SEO.

Give your page a title that is descriptive and concise.
